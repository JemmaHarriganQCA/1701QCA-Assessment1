### Experiment Name ###

3 Button Buzzer (6)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt more about the music side of the microbit, how I can use the buttons to play different sounds. I was also impressed at how many different songs it can play.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as any buzzer or signifier.

### Experiment name ###

Motion Control (5)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to use the movement sensors in the Microbit. This was a fun one because it didn't realise how it worked til later and it was cool to see it work like it should.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a kids toy like a motion toy helicopter or a tilt puzzle.

### Experiment name ###

Capacitor Charge Circuit (9)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how the math tool is very useful and it starting to look like it has applications in the real world.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a charger, telling you how charged something is, or how much something has loaded.

### Experiment name ###

Home-made mood lighting

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the dynamic use of colour in light and how easy it is to change it to something that you like.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a colour-changing light or a pool light.

### Experiment name ###

Day sensor

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to use a light sensor and even using the Microbit by itself to light up as well.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a light sensor, to start a process or turn something on.
