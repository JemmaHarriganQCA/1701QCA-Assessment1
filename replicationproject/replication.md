# Assessment 1: Replication project

*Fill out the following workbook with information relevant to your project.*

*Markdown reference:* [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Replication project choice ##
(Insert the name of the project you chose to replicate.)

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

### Related project 1 ###
(Insert name of project)

(Insert URL to project)

This project is related to mine because (insert reasons here).

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I thought before: Ignorance to the thinking behind products and how our brains work in that way. Its not something that I had ever thought of.

What I learned: In this article I learnt about how the brain percieves something in such a way that something it has never seen before, it can work out how to use it. Its interesting the way a good design can be put together to not have instructions to have the user use the product staright away.

What I would like to know more about: I would like to learn more about good signifiers and how people have used them in good designs.

How this relates to the project I am working on: I want my design to be good enough that someone can work out how to use it with minimal instructions, having a clear aim and purpose.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

What I thought before: I don't think I completely understood what I was creating or how much it mattered in the view of the world and its new technology. Also how much of a difference a Microinteraction can make.

What I learned: How the process should go, creating a product, as well as the importance of Microinteractions and having a good design to it. It truly makes a difference all of the little details that you put into it. Like how they talked about the difference between phones, the little annoying things that differentiate them from the rest, giving good examples of how good design matters.

What I would like to know more about: The right degree of giving something functionality, but with the least technicality possible, to make something simple but complictaed enough.

How this relates to the project I am working on: This gives me good advice about how I am going to design my plant waterer, how I can change it to have a better design, to make it easy yet is completely functional.

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

What I thought before: I thought that the process was quite simple, but there can be many layers to designing something. As well as that you would only start something if you were determined to make it.

What I learned: I learnt that things dont always turn out the way they seem that they will. I thought the case study was interesting to read. Firstly, because of the way it started, it came out of an interest to learn more about something. It turned into a full scale project that helped people out. What also surprised me was the amount of times it didnt work, so they had to find a new solution and if they hadn't used it before they took it as an opportunity to learn more.

What I would like to know more about: I dont know much about these things, but I thought the motion sensors were interesting and would maybe like to try it out oneday.

How this relates to the project I am working on: I think just the general attitude of the author when he is going through all of it. Many of the experiments I am doing don't always work out and I tend to give up, so with this class I think I can take on a can-do attitude, even though I feel like I am not getting anywhere.


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
