This project is related to mine because of the use of Servo Motors, through the interaction of a sensor. They use motion, whilst I use a soil moisture sensor. 

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I thought before: Ignorance to the thinking behind products and how our brains work in that way. Its not something that I had ever thought of.

What I learned: In this article I learnt about how the brain percieves something in such a way that something it has never seen before, it can work out how to use it. Its interesting the way a good design can be put together to not have instructions to have the user use the product staright away.

What I would like to know more about: I would like to learn more about good signifiers and how people have used them in good designs.

How this relates to the project I am working on: I want my design to be good enough that someone can work out how to use it with minimal instructions, having a clear aim and purpose.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

What I thought before: I don't think I completely understood what I was creating or how much it mattered in the view of the world and its new technology. Also how much of a difference a Microinteraction can make.

What I learned: How the process should go, creating a product, as well as the importance of Microinteractions and having a good design to it. It truly makes a difference all of the little details that you put into it. Like how they talked about the difference between phones, the little annoying things that differentiate them from the rest, giving good examples of how good design matters.

What I would like to know more about: The right degree of giving something functionality, but with the least technicality possible, to make something simple but complictaed enough.

How this relates to the project I am working on: This gives me good advice about how I am going to design my plant waterer, how I can change it to have a better design, to make it easy yet is completely functional.

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

What I thought before: I thought that the process was quite simple, but there can be many layers to designing something. As well as that you would only start something if you were determined to make it.

What I learned: I learnt that things dont always turn out the way they seem that they will. I thought the case study was interesting to read. Firstly, because of the way it started, it came out of an interest to learn more about something. It turned into a full scale project that helped people out. What also surprised me was the amount of times it didnt work, so they had to find a new solution and if they hadn't used it before they took it as an opportunity to learn more.

What I would like to know more about: I dont know much about these things, but I thought the motion sensors were interesting and would maybe like to try it out oneday.

How this relates to the project I am working on: I think just the general attitude of the author when he is going through all of it. Many of the experiments I am doing don't always work out and I tend to give up, so with this class I think I can take on a can-do attitude, even though I feel like I am not getting anywhere.

## Process documentation

I chose to replicate the self plant watering system because it looked interesting in that it was practical as well as involving plants, which I have a lot at home and enjoy keeping. 
It took me a bit to manage to get all my materials, I had to wait for them to come in the mail, but when they got here I started off with my soil moisture sensor.

![Material List](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/78201993-73a15e00-74d6-11ea-847c-e119ef98491b.JPG)

![Materials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/78202033-887df180-74d6-11ea-9eeb-f77d1bdff5b3.JPG)

![Moisture sensor flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/78208418-b4ee3980-74e7-11ea-8177-8b99a431347e.JPG)

I followed the first step of testing the dry and wet dirt to callibrate the Microbit, taking the Javascript from the insructions on the Makecode website. 

I was a little confused at why it didnt work for a while, the Microbit lit up with every touch of the soil, then I realised I didn't need to stick the nails in that far, just to touch the surface and it worked fine.

Next step was to make it show a reading when I pressed A on the Microbit, using similar coding but adding numbers between 1-1023 instead of the bar graph, it read the numbers 442 on the dry soil and 1004 for the wet soil. 

The last step of my moisture tester was to lower the power through the brightness and the amount of time it had to take the reading. It added a couple of seconds between the readings. I thought this was good but kind of confusing when it came to working out what was meant to be happening as a result. It worked fine when I realised the time gap between the readings.

With the success of the Soil Moisture tester, I began to code for the Self waterer. It essentially added the Micro-servo motor, making it tilt 80 degrees then pausing then tilting back to its original position. A well as simply adding to the moisture sensor code so when it read that it was below 500 it would water the plant, when it read it was over 500 then it wouldn't. I copied the code from the instructional website.

The next step was to build the project. I had studied it a few times before so I went ahead to put it all together. 

![Project Diagram ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62362612/78201959-59678000-74d6-11ea-80a1-ec04c361d50b.JPG)

My materials worked fine til I added the microbit in and put on all the wires and clips. I realised that I needed a better setup with the pot and the cup with the water. The cup was too small so the lever wouldn't reach the pot properly. So I went to find a taller cup and a smaller pot plant to use. I found the perfect size and tested it with the whole process to find that it worked perfectly.

### Reflection ###

I thought this project was successful, it didn't take much time to build and I understood it easy enough to see what was happening and to fix any problems that occured. I think it could have been better with a more convenient design where one didn't see all the wires and could move it all as one body. This project could have many relevant implications through this.

I think the Article we read about above, Protoyping Interactive Objects by Scott Sullivan, was inspiring the way he kept going and learning from his mistakes, when things didn't work out they way he thought he found another solution. This inspired me to keep going even when it was frustrating when I didn't think my project was working. 

I was inspired by many of the other projects that I found on the internet, all the ways people were using plants as a part of interactive art as well as science. Using the natural sources from the soil/plants to make something creative. For example, The interactive sound plant was quite simple, it included just the plant the chip and a computer. Yet the simplicity reinforced the purpose of the project, to show the aliveness of plants, we can read their signs/feelings and feed them. This project as well as the plethora of other similar projects showed me how much alive plants can be and how we can show and use it.

I think this project could be extended to a moving self-waterer. If we ever get to a place where everthing is done by robots, this project could be made into a robot that can move around the house and water the plants when they need to be. This could be done inside and outside, in public places for example. There are also many other implications that this project could go, the many exemplars that I found for this project as an example, using the plants signs and feelings to educate or make something creative out of.
